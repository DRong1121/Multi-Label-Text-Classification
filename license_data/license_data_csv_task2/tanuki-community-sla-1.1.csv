13,the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
14,whether that is true depends on what the program does,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

20,exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
21,these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

31,if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
