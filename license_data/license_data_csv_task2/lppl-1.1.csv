7,you must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
8,in the modified file you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file and the name if any of the program which contains it,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
9,you must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
10,you must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in the program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
11,you must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
12,you must do either a or b a distribute a copy of the program that is a complete unmodified copy of the program together with the modified file if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the program from the same place meets this condition even though third parties are not compelled to copy the program along with the modified file b provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of the program for example you may provide a uniform resource locator url for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of the program free of charge either the version from which your modification is derived or perhaps a later version,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
13,note that in the above `distribution of a file means making the file available to others by any means,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
14,this includes for instance installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

16,changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
17,the distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
18,note however that condition 7 does apply to any such modified file,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
19,the conditions above are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the updating by any method of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of the program,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
20,a recommendation on modification without distribution                                                       it is wise never to modify a file of the program even for your own personal use without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
21,while you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed often this will happen by accident    you may forget that you have modified the file or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
22,it is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the program identical with the public one,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
23,many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
24,additional conditions on individual files of the program                                                          an individual file of the program may bear additional conditions that supplement and or supersede the conditions in this license if and only if such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
25,the conditions on individual files of the program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
26,additional conditions on latex software files                                               if a file of the program is intended to be used with latex that is if it is a latex software file then the following additional conditions which supplement and or supersede the conditions above apply to the file according to its filename extension   you may not modify any file with filename extension `ins since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
27,  you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `fd latex font definition files under the standard conditions of the lppl as described above,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
28,you may also distribute such modified latex font definition files with their original names provided that 1 the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts 2 you also distribute the original unmodified files tex input paths can be used to control which set of latex font definition files is actually used by tex,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
29,  you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `cfg configuration files with their original names,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
30,the program may and usually will specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
31,because of portability and exchangeability issues in latex software the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
32,no warranty there is no warranty for the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

39,choosing this license or another license                                          if for any part of your program you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
40,you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the lppl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
41,the document `modguidetex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
42,it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
43,even if your program is unrelated to latex the discussion in `modguidetex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
44,how to use this license                         to use this license place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
45,here is an example of such a notice and statement %% pigdtx %% copyright 2001 m y,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
46,name % % this program may be distributed and or modified under the % conditions of the latex project public license either version 11 % of this license or at your option any later version,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
47,% the latest version of this license is in % http  wwwlatex projectorg lppltxt % and version 11 or later is part of all distributions of latex % version 1999 06 01 or later,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
48,% % this program consists of the files pigdtx and pigins given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with `the program referring to the two files `pigdtx and `pigins and `the copyright holder referring to the person `m y,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
49,important recommendations                           defining what constitutes the program the lppl requires that distributions of the program contain all the files of the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
50,it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
51,this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like % this program consists of all files listed in manifesttxt,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
52,in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the program,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53,noting exceptional files if the program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification or on distribution of modified versions of those files other than those listed in `additional conditions on latex software files then it is recommended that the program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
54,files containing the text of a license such as this file are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
55,latex configuration files with filename extension `cfg are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
