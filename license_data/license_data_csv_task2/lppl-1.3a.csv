51,choosing this license or another license                                          if for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but instead distribute your work under a different license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
52,you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
53,the document `modguidetex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
54,it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

56,a recommendation on modification without distribution                                                       it is wise never to modify a component of the work even for your own personal use without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
57,while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed often this will happen by accident    you may forget that you have modified that component or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and worse cause problems for the community,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1
58,it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
59,many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
60,how to use this license                         to use this license place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and or last substantially modified,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1
61,include also a statement that the distribution and or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
62,here is an example of such a notice and statement %% pigdtx %% copyright 2003 m y,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
63,name % % this work may be distributed and or modified under the % conditions of the latex project public license either version 13 % of this license or at your option any later version,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
64,% the latest version of this license is in % http  wwwlatex projectorg lppltxt % and version 13 or later is part of all distributions of latex % version 2003 12 01 or later,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
65,% % this work has the lppl maintenance status maintained,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
66,% % this current maintainer of this work is m y,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
67,% % this work consists of the files pigdtx and pigins % and the derived file pigsty,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
68,given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the `work referring to the three files `pigdtx `pigins and `pigsty the last being generated from `pigdtx using `pigins the `base interpreter referring to any latex format and both `copyright holder and `current maintainer referring to the person `m y,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
69,if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work change maintained above into author maintained,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
70,however we recommend that you use maintained as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
71,important recommendations                           defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
72,it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
73,this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as % this work consists of all files listed in manifesttxt,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
