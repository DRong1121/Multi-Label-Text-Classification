This code grew slowly over time without much design or planning, and with extra features being tacked on as required. It's not representative of my normal coding style.

This version of dumpasn1 requires a config file dumpasn1.cfg to be present in the same location as the program itself or in a standard directory where binaries live (it will run without it but will display a warning message, you can configure the path either by hardcoding it in or using an environment variable as explained further down). The config file is available from http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/dumpasn1.cfg

This code assumes that the input data is binary, having come from a MIME-aware mailer or been piped through a decoding utility if the original format used base64 encoding. If you need to decode it, it's recommended that you use a utility like uudeview, which will strip virtually any kind of encoding (MIME, PEM, PGP, whatever) to recover the binary original.

You can use this code in whatever way you want, as long as you don't try to claim you wrote it.
