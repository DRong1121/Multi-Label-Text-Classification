You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 1, as long as:

You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves,
all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves,
are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and
any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program, a Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.

If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from Alfresco Software, Ltd.

Due to the many variants of some of the above licenses, we require that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of the Open Source Definition by the Open Source Initiative (http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php).
