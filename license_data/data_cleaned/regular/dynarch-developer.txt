Here is an example to make clear the distinction between an Application and a Library: the Opera Web Browser is an Application built on top of the Qt Toolkit. While Opera has a finite scope (it is a Web browser), Qt is also used in a lot of other applications, for instance the KDE Desktop. Qt is a Library for developers, while Opera is a general audience Application.
