10,activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this licence they are outside its scope,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11,the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12,whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

20,if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
21,you may not copy modify sublicence link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this licence,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
