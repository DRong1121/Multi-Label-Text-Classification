1,the license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,by contrast our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share gnu elib,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,to make sure that you get the rights we want you to have we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,specifically we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of gnu elib that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it that you can change gnu elib or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,to make sure that everyone has such rights we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,for example if you distribute copies of gnu elib you must give the recipients all the rights that you have,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,also for our own protection we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for gnu elib,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,if gnu elib is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,therefore we make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change gnu elib,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of gnu elib source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice copyright c 1992 free software foundation or with whatever year is appropriate keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this license agreement and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the gnu elib program a copy of this license agreement along with the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,you may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,you may modify your copy or copies of gnu elib or any portion of it and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of paragraph 1 above provided that you also do the following cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change and cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of gnu elib or any part thereof to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this license agreement except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties at your option,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,you may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program or its derivative on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other program under the scope of these terms,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,you may copy and distribute gnu elib or any portion of it in under paragraph 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above or accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party free except for a nominal shipping charge a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above or accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,for an executable file complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains but as a special exception it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,you may not copy sublicense distribute or transfer gnu elib except as expressly provided under this license agreement,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,any attempt otherwise to copy sublicense distribute or transfer gnu elib is void and your rights to use the program under this license agreement shall be automatically terminated,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,however parties who have received computer software programs from you with this license agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,if you wish to incorporate parts of gnu elib into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the free software foundation at 675 mass ave cambridge ma 02139,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,we have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here but we will often permit this,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,we will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our software are welcome!,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,please contact the free software foundation inc 675 mass ave cambridge ma 02139 or call 617 876 3296,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,no warranty because gnu elib is licensed free of charge we provide absolutely no warranty to the extent permitted by applicable state law,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,except when otherwise stated in writing free software foundation inc inge wallin and or other parties provide gnu elib as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,the entire risk as to the quality and performance of gnu elib is with you,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,should gnu elib prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,
