2,abstract upx and ucl are copyrighted software distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license hereinafter the gpl,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,the stub which is imbedded in each upx compressed program is part of upx and ucl and contains code that is under our copyright,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,the terms of the gnu general public license still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,as a special exception we grant the free usage of upx for all executables including commercial programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,upx is copyright c 1996 2000 markus franz xaver johannes oberhumer upx is copyright c 1996 2000 laszlo molnar ucl is copyright c 1996 2000 markus franz xaver johannes oberhumer gnu general public license upx and the ucl library are free software you can redistribute them and or modify them under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 2 of the license or at your option any later version,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,see the gnu general public license for more details,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program see the file copying,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,special exception for compressed executables the stub which is imbedded in each upx compressed program is part of upx and ucl and contains code that is under our copyright,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,the terms of the gnu general public license still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,oberhumer and laszlo molnar grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all upx compressed programs including commercial ones subject to the following restrictions 1,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,you must compress your program with a completely unmodified upx version either with our precompiled version or at your option with a self compiled version of the unmodified upx sources as distributed by us,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,this also implies that the upx stub must be completely unmodfied iethe stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte identical to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified upx version,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,the decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get used by the unmodified upx stub for decompressing your program at program startup,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,no portion of the stub may get read copied called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,annotations   you can use a modified upx version or modified upx stub only for programs that are compatible with the gnu general public license,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,  we grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all upx compressed programs,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,but any modification of the upx stub such as but not limited to removing our copyright string or making your program non decompressible will immediately revoke your right to use and distribute a upx compressed program,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,  upx is not a software protection tool by requiring that you use the unmodified upx version for your proprietary programs we make sure that any user can decompress your program,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,this protects both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code   any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious by definition,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,  you can integrate all or part of upx and ucl into projects that are compatible with the gnu gpl but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions beyond the gpl for our code in your project,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,  we want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and similar security software,,,,,,,,,,,,
