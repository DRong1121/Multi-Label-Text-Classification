1,opyright c 1997 julian smart markus holzem finally the licence specifies that any patent involving wxwidgets must be licenced for everyones free use,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,wxwidgets licence terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,this licence agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this wxwidgets licence also called this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this licence they are outside its scope,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this licence and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this licence along with the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,with agreement from the authors of wxwidgets you may charge for value added to the library for example a commercially supported version or a port to a new platform,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,it is expected that collaboration between such commercial interests and the free wxwidgets community will yield benefits to both parties since wxwidgets represents a substantial investment of time and effort,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,it is not in the spirit of this agreement that commercial exploitation of wxwidgets should in any way detract from the free version,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,you may copy and distribute the library in object code or derived library form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,you may not copy modify sublicence link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicence link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this licence will not have their licences terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,you are not required to accept this licence since you have not signed it,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this licence to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a licence from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this licence they do not excuse you from the conditions of this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this licence and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,for example if a patent licence would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this licence would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public licence practices,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licencee cannot impose that choice,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this licence may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,in such case this licence incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,the authors of wxwidgets may publish revised and or new versions of the wxwidgets licence from time to time,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,if the library specifies a version number of this licence which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the wxwidgets authors,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,if the library does not specify a licence version number you may choose any version ever published by the wxwidgets authors,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the program author to ask for permission,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,for software which is copyrighted by the wxwidgets authors write to the wxwidgets authors,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,because the library is licenced free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,
