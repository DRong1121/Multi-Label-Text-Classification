2,for legal purposes this document is the license under which opencontent is made available for use,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,the original version of this document may be found at http  wwwopencontentorg oplhtml license terms and conditions for copying distributing and modifying items other than copying distributing and modifying the content with which this license was distributed such as using etc,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,you may copy and distribute exact replicas of the opencontent oc as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the oc a copy of this license along with the oc,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,you may at your option charge a fee for the media and or handling involved in creating a unique copy of the oc for use offline you may at your option offer instructional support for the oc in exchange for a fee or you may at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,you may not charge a fee for the oc itself,,,,,,,,,,,,

9,you may modify your copy or copies of the opencontent or any portion of it thus forming works based on the content and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified content to carry prominent notices stating that you changed it the exact nature and content of the changes and the date of any change,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the oc or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license unless otherwise permitted under applicable fair use law,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the oc and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the oc the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,exceptions are made to this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this license only in compliance with fair use law where applicable,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,however nothing else grants you permission to copy distribute or modify the oc,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,therefore by distributing or translating the oc or by deriving works herefrom you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or translating the oc,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,because the opencontent oc is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the oc to the extent permitted by applicable law,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the oc as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,the entire risk of use of the oc is with you,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,should the oc prove faulty inaccurate or otherwise unacceptable you assume the cost of all necessary repair or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,
