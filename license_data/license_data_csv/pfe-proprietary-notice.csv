1,you expect me to believe that this stuff is free?,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,i could get people to pay for this?,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,yes its completely free   youll find the minimalist terms and conditions in the various readme files you do look at readme files dont you?,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,in the release zip archives and in the help file but basically you can use pfe at home at work in the car and any improbable location of your choice without paying me a penny or cent if youre across the planet from where i am,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,but in the unlikely circumstance that you actually think youd like to distribute pfe with your commercial product   no dont laugh   it was known to happen   i would want to sell you a licence,,,,,,,,,,,,
