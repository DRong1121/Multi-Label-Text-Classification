1,there are currently six explicit copyrights on portions of unzip code at least of which info zip is aware the original sam smith copyright on unzip 20 upon which info zips unzip 30 was based igor mandrichenkos copyright on his routines in vmsc greg roelofs copyright on zipinfoc and the new version of unshrinkc mike whites copyright on the windows dll code windll steve p millers copyright on the pocket unzip gui wince and norbert pueschels copyright on the amiga timelib code,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,in addition mark adler has placed inflateh inflatec explodec and funzipc into the public domain ie these files may be used without any restrictions beyond those of simple courtesy credit where its due,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,the remaining code is covered by an im  plicit copyright under us law,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,frequently asked questions regarding redistribution of zip and unzip are near the end of this file,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,there are no known patents on any of the code in unzip,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,unisys claims a patent on lzw encoding and on lzw decoding _in an apparatus that performs lzw encoding_ but the patent appears to exempt a stand  alone decoder as in unzips unshrinkc,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,unisys has publicly claimed otherwise but the issue has never been tested in court,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,since this point is unclear unshrinking is not enabled by default,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,it is the responsibility of the user to make his or her peace with unisys and its licensing requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,the original unzip source code has been extensively modified and almost entirely rewritten changes include random zipfile access rather than sequential replacement of unimplode with explode replacement of old unshrink with new unrelated unshrink re  placement of output routines addition of inflate wildcards filename mapping text translation  etc,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,as far as we can tell the only remaining code that is substantially similar to mr smiths is that in the file unreducec which now by default is not compiled,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,the following copyright applies to unreducec copyright 1989 samuel h smith all rights reserved do not distribute modified versions without my permission,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,if you use this in your own program you must distribute source code,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,do not use any of this in a commercial product,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,regarding the first stipulation mr smith was tracked down in southern california some years back [samuel h smith the tool shop as of mid  may 1994 213 851 9969 voice 213 887 2127?,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,subscription bbs 711502731@compuservecom] he says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that he has no objection to the info zip groups inclusion of his code,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,his primary concern is that it remain freely distributable he said,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,despite the fact that our normal code has been entirely rewritten and by default no longer contains any of mr smiths code info zip remains indebted and grateful to him,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,we hope he finds our contribu  tions as useful as we have his,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com  pany that wishes to incorporate the unreduce code into its products if you wish to do so you must contact mr smith directly regarding licensing,,,,,,,,,,,,

44,                                                                        frequently asked questions about distributing zip and unzip q,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,can i distribute zip and unzip sources and or executables?,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,you may redistribute the latest official distributions without any modification and without even asking us for permission,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,note that an executable distribution includes documentation even if its in a separate zipfile plain executables do not count,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,you can charge for the cost of the media cdrom disk  ettes etc,,,,,,,,,,,,
49, the compilation eg of a software archive and a small copying fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,distributed archives should follow the naming conventions used in the `where file,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,if you want to distribute modified versions please contact us at zip bugs@listswkuedu first,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,you must not distribute beta versions without explicit permission to do so,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,can i use the executables or dlls of zip and unzip to distribute my software?,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,yes so long as it is clear that zip and unzip are not being sold that the source code is freely available and that there are no extra or hidden charges resulting from its use by or in  clusion with the commercial product,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,here is an example of a suitable notice note <product> is packaged on this cd using info zips compression utility,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,the installation program uses unzip to read zip files from the cd,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,info zips software zip unzip and related utilities is free and can be obtained as source code or executables from internet www sites including http  wwwcdromcom pub infozip  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,if the distribution is being done with unzipsfx instead of a dll or stand alone copy of unzip ie as one or more self extracting archives no notice is required as long as the normal unzipsfx banner has not been removed,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,can i use the source code of zip and unzip in my commercial application?,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,yes so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment a pointer to the original free compression sources and a statement making it clear that there are no extra or hidden charges resulting from the use of our compression code in your product see below for an example,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,the acknowledgment should appear in at least one piece of human readable documentation eg a readme file or man page although additionally putting it in the executables is ok too,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,in other words you are allowed to sell only your own work not ours and wed like a little credit,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,note the additional restrictions above on the code in unreducec unshrinkc vmsc time_libc and everything in the wince and windll subdirectories,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,contact us at zip bugs@listswkuedu if you have special requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,we also like to hear when our code is being used but we dont require that,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,<product> incorporates compression code from the info zip group,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,there are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code and the original compression sources are freely available from http  wwwcdromcom pub infozip  or ftp  ftpcdromcom pub infozip  on the internet,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,if you only need compression capability not full zipfile support you might want to look at zlib instead it has fewer restrictions on commercial use,,,,,,,,,,,,
