1,the qwt library and included programs are provided under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license lgpl with the following exceptions 1,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,widgets that are subclassed from qwt widgets do not constitute a derivative work,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,static linking of applications and widgets to the qwt library does not constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide source code for the application or widget use the shared qwt libraries or link their applications or widgets against a user supplied version of qwt,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,if you link the application or widget to a modified version of qwt then the changes to qwt must be provided under the terms of the lgpl in sections 1 2 and 4,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,you do not have to provide a copy of the qwt license with programs that are linked to the qwt library nor do you have to identify the qwt license in your program or documentation as required by section 6 of the lgpl,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,however programs must still identify their use of qwt,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,the following example statement can be included in user documentation to satisfy this requirement [program widget] is based in part on the work of the qwt project http  qwtsfnet,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,                                                                       gnu lesser general public license version 21 february 1999 copyright c 1991 1999 free software foundation inc 59 temple place suite 330 boston ma 02111 1307 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,[this is the first released version of the lesser gpl,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license version 2 hence the version number 21],,,,,,,,,,,,
11,gnu lesser general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the librarys complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,therefore subsection 2d requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version 2 instead of to this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,do not make any other change in these notices,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,any executables containing that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customers own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,a suitable mechanism is one that 1 uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the users computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and 2 will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interface compatible with the version that the work was made with,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,
