1,scope this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this atmosphere license,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,whether that is true depends on what the program does,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,verbatim copies you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the programs source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,modified copies you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that each time you do so you also meet all of these conditions a,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,d you must divest from all disqualifying assets as listed in section 3 e you must comply with any obligations to remote users as defined below,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,obligations to remote users notwithstanding any other provision of this license you may allow users to interact with your modified version remotely through a computer network only if you meet the following obligations to remote users a your modified version of the program must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no charge through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,divestment divestment of an asset means relinquishing all ownership interest in the asset all profit rights in the asset or right to control the asset through sale or other disposal of the asset or placing the asset under a conservation easement or other effective legal restriction valid for at least three years barring use of the asset for the activities that caused it to qualify as a disqualifying asset,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,disqualifying assets subject to divestment under the terms of this license include disqualifying investments and disqualifying facilities,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,a disqualifying investment is any investment exceeding $10000 in value in a company agency or entity that operates any disqualifying facility or has a majority ownership interest or majority profit rights in any disqualifying facility,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,a disqualifying investment may take the form of direct ownership shares commingled mutual funds containing shares or corporate bonds,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,source code you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under sections 2 and 3 in object code or executable form under the terms of the sections above provided that you also do one of the following a,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,termination you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,acceptance you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,additional terms each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,if the original license omitted any of the optional provisions regarding privacy of remote users deforestation nonrenewable power generation civilian internment or for profit prisons you may add one or more of those provisions to the license as additional terms when conveying modified versions of the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,however you may not add the offset for renewable investments provision,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,you may also subject parts of the program to restrictions derived from the apache license version 20 regarding matters such as patent termination and indemnification if those parts of the program were previously licensed under the apache license,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,this is necessary to stay in compliance with the apache license when relicensing under the atmosphere license,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,to do this add the phrase subject to restrictions in apache license version 20 to the boilerplate atmosphere license notices for your program or for the files or other parts of the program that were covered by the apache license,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,inconsistent conditions if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free and ethical software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,an author donor distributes software through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,permission from authors if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other programs whose distribution conditions are different or if you wish to distribute modified versions of the program or offer users remote network interaction with a modified version of the program without divesting from disqualifying assets write to the authors to ask for permission to do so under the terms of a different license,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,no warranty because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,no liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages,,,,,,,,,,,,
